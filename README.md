# Zephyr Development

Thin Zephyr [module][zephyr-module] to provide an integration test playground for Zephyr development.

The goal is to provide an agent-friendly environment for Zephyr development, without having to work exclusively in the Zephyr tree.
This repo should be a staging ground for ideas and prototypes, before migrating these to [Finwood/zephyr](https://github.com/Finwood/zephyr) for upstream integration.

## Setup

This repository is a Zephyr T2 workspace (west manifest repo + module). Python tooling is managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); the shell environment is configured in [`.envrc`](.envrc) and is meant to be loaded automatically with [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

0. Install **uv** if you do not have it yet: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

1. Create the Python virtual environment and install dependencies (including west):

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

2. Fetch the west workspace (Zephyr and module dependencies):

   ```bash
   uv run west update
   ```

3. Install the **Zephyr SDK** matching this workspace's Zephyr version. From the repository root, with `ZEPHYR_BASE` pointing at the checked-out Zephyr tree:

   ```bash
   export ZEPHYR_BASE=$PWD/deps/zephyr
   uv run west sdk install -b /opt
   ```

   This installs the SDK version from `deps/zephyr/SDK_VERSION` (see the [Zephyr SDK version compatibility matrix](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/sdk-ng/wiki/Zephyr-Version-Compatibility#zephyr-sdk-version-compatibility-matrix)). The `-b /opt` base directory matches [`.envrc`](.envrc), which sets `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR=/opt/` when a `zephyr-sdk-*` directory is present there.

   To install only the toolchains you need (smaller download), add `-t`, for example:

   ```bash
   uv run west sdk install -b /opt -t x86_64-zephyr-elf    # native_sim
   uv run west sdk install -b /opt -t arm-zephyr-eabi      # typical ARM MCUs
   ```

4. Allow direnv to load the project environment (once per machine):

   ```bash
   direnv allow
   ```

   On each `cd` into this repository, direnv runs `.envrc`, which activates the uv virtualenv, adds `scripts/` to `PATH`, and exports Zephyr/SDK variables (`ZEPHYR_TOOLCHAIN_VARIANT`, `ZEPHYR_SDK_INSTALL_DIR`, etc.). Without direnv, source the venv and export those variables manually before building.
